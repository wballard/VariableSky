## Overview
Variable Sky security model is similar to a file system, it's all about
Authentication and Authorization.

## Authentication
Variable Sky operates over Web Sockets, upgrading from an initial HTTP
Connection. As such, you can use pretty much any authentication
mechansim, as long as it results in setting `req.user`, which then
exposes a `req.user.id`. This is picked up by the server Web
Socket to bind an identity to a client->server connection.

A good choice is [Passport](http://passportjs.org), which lets you plug
in all kinds of stuff. The basics:

* Have a _login page_
* Log in
* `variablesky.connect()` after the log in redirect


Variable Sky understands passport and automatically sets up
`passport.serializeUser` and `passport.deserializeUser`, storing them in
Variable Sky itself. This takes the security cookie generated by
passport and turns it into a server side `user` automatically. This
`user`, specifically `user.id` is then used to check permissions and
ownership.

## Users and Groups
Users are individuals, Groups are sets of users. These are stored in
Variable Sky as special 'hidden' data in `/.users/` and `/.groups`,
owned by the system itself, not any specific user.

Users are stored with the pattern `/.users/{{userid}}`, and set to be
readable by everyone, and writable only by the system itself.

Groups are stored with the pattern `/.groups/{{groupid}}/{{userid}}`
with one entry for each group member. Groups are created by users, not
the system. The idea is that users create groups as needed to share
data.

## Ownership
Data you create, you own. The only exception being if you are not logged
in, in chich case there is no owner. Owners can do anything they like to
the data, and unowned data is open access.

## Permissions
There are just three:

* read - get the data at a link on down
* write - replace all the data at a link, recursively as you can replace
* extend - add new data properties to a link, but not replace others

Only owners can change the permissions, but you can change the owner
from yourself to a group.

Permissions are granted via [Link](./api.html#Link). For
the most part, you will grant permissions on data you create and own to
other users or groups.

## Securing
Two basic approaches, and you can use them both:

In your sever, where you set up your hooks, you can set permissions from
a `link()`. The server runs as system, and can poke at anything.

```javascript
var server = new Server();
//sharing with fred
server.link('/mine').takeOwnership().allowWrite('fred').allowRead('fred');
//giving to fred
server.link('/freds').changeOwnership('fred');
//keeping out those pesky smurfs
server.link('/nosmurfs').allowRead('cats').denyRead('smurfs');
```

And, in a client, you can call the same methods on a link, however they
will always be as a user, not the system, so you can't poke at just
anything -- only at your own.
